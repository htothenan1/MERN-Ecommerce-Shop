# MERN Ecommerce Experiment

This project is an exercise in the basics of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS).
My goal is to build a fully functional ecommerce web application, complete with shopping cart,
checkout processing, and reviews.

Additional technologies used:

- React-Redux
- Nodemon
- Concurrently
- Mongoose
- Express async handler
- Bcrypt
- Dotenv
- React Bootstrap
- JSON web token
- React PayPal button
- Font Awesome
